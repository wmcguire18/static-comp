                  <h2>Film: COME DRINK WITH ME</h2>
                  <h4>Synopsis: At the dawn of the modern wuxia film, a genius director and a ruthless producer went to war over a brilliant and beautiful swordsman picture. The film, COME DRINK WITH ME, is to this day regarded as a masterpiece of Chinese language cinema and remains the only film King Hu ever directed for Shaw Brothers.</h4>

                        <h4>Synopsis: No director is more responsible for the development, refinement, and execution of the Shaw Brothers style than the legendary Chang Cheh. Cheh mixed youth in rebellion with Chinese pulp fiction, the violence of Japanese samurai films, and the swagger of James Bond. No film better embodies the scope and sweep of this cocktail than BLOOD BROTHERS, the standout picture made with David Chiang and Ti Lung, who would come to be known along with Cheh as "the Iron Triangle."</h4>

                                    <h4>Synopsis: In the early 70's, the cinema of Hong Kong became an international sensation-- a boom of unprecedented popularity for the tiny colonial industry. This boom in popularity coincided with the transition from historical swordsman films, or wuxia, films to modern, hard-hitting films built around hand to hand fighting. In Hong Kong they were called "bashers" but for the rest of the world the deluge of films came to be known as the "Kung Fu Boom". This month, we examine the very first film to get an American release: KING BOXER! </h4>

This month, we examine Chung's most influential film: the tragic and pulse-pounding revenge thriller THE AVENGING EAGLE.</h4>
